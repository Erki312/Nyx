# Nyx - Modified Monochrome Astrophotography Camera

**Nyx** is a modified version of the Lumenera LW11059C camera, specifically tailored for advanced astrophotography applications. Named after the Greek goddess of the night, Nyx is designed to capture deep-sky objects and celestial phenomena with exceptional clarity and detail. The modifications focus on maximizing light sensitivity, reducing thermal noise, and providing flexibility through a custom-built filter system, making it a versatile tool for long-exposure and narrowband imaging.

## Key Features

### 1. Modified Monochrome CCD Sensor
Nyx utilizes the high-resolution CCD sensor of the Lumenera LW11059C, optimized for monochrome imaging. By removing the color filter array, the sensor captures the full spectrum of light in each exposure, providing high-contrast and detailed black-and-white images.

### 2. Custom-Built 7-Position Automated Filter Wheel
To enhance the monochrome imaging capabilities, Nyx is equipped with a custom-built 7-position automated filter wheel. This system allows for precise control over various narrowband and broadband filters, enabling the capture of specific wavelengths such as:
- **Hydrogen-alpha (Ha)**
- **Oxygen-III (OIII)**
- **Sulfur-II (SII)**
- **LRGB Filters**: For creating high-quality, color composite images by capturing separate luminance (L) and RGB (Red, Green, Blue) channels.

These filters are essential for creating high-quality composite images, mapping out nebulae structures, and capturing vivid colors in deep-sky objects.

### 3. Efficient Cooling System
To minimize thermal noise during long exposures, Nyx integrates a Peltier cooling system directly behind the CCD sensor. The cooling mechanism reduces the sensorâ€™s operating temperature, ensuring clearer images with reduced dark current.

### 4. Gas-Sealed Sensor Chamber
The area in front of the sensor, extending to the protective glass, is filled with **argon gas** to prevent condensation and ensure a dry environment. This feature is crucial for maintaining optimal performance during long imaging sessions in varying temperature conditions.

### 5. Enhanced Modularity and Flexibility
Designed with modularity in mind, Nyx allows for future upgrades and easy integration of additional accessories, such as different filter configurations or alternative cooling methods. This adaptability ensures that the camera remains a versatile tool for various astrophotography applications.

## Project Goals
- **High-Quality Monochrome Imaging**: Achieve superior image quality through optimized cooling, precise filter management, and advanced sensor calibration.
- **Long-Exposure Capability**: Reduce noise levels and maintain stability during long imaging sessions, ideal for capturing faint celestial objects and deep-sky phenomena.
- **Simple Software Development**: Develop an easy-to-use software solution to control both the camera and the filter wheel, allowing for seamless operation and integration.
- **Detailed Documentation and Open Source**: The project will be documented comprehensively, with schematics, build instructions, and software details provided to support other enthusiasts in building or modifying their own versions of Nyx.
